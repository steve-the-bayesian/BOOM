\title{
  Local level trend state component
}

\description{
  Add a shared local level model to a state specification.
  The shared local level model assumes the trend is a
  multivariate random walk:

  \deqn{\alpha_{t+1} = \alpha_t + \eta_t \qquad
    \eta_{tj} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_j).}{%
    alpha[t+1, ] = alpha[t, ] + rnorm(nfactors, 0, sigma). }

  The contribution to the mean of the observed series obeys \deqn{y_{t}
  = B \alpha_t + \epsilon_t.}{y[t, ] = B \%*\% alpha[t, ]} plus
  observation error.  Identifiability constraints imply that the
  observation coefficients \code{B} form a rectangular lower triangular
  matrix with diagonal 1.0.

  If there are \eqn{m} time series and \eqn{p} factors, then \eqn{B} has
  \eqn{m} rows and \eqn{p} columns.  Having \eqn{B} be lower triangular
  means that the first factor affects all series.  The second affects
  all but the first, the third excludes the first two, etc.

\usage{
  AddSharedLocalLevel(
     state.specification,
     response,
     nfactors,
     coefficient.prior = NULL,
     initial.state.prior = NULL,
     timestamps = NULL,
     series.id = NULL,
     sdy,
     ...)
}

\arguments{

  \item{state.specification}{A pre-existing list of state components
    that you wish to add to.  If omitted, an empty list will be assumed.
  }

  \item{response}{ The time series to be modeled. This can either be a
    matrix with rows as time and columns as series, or it can be a numeric
    vector.  If a vector is passed then \code{timestamps} and
    \code{series.id} are required.  Otherwise they are unused.}

  \item{nfactors}{The number of latent factors to include in the model.
    This is the dimension of the state for this model component.}

  \item{coefficient.prior}{Prior distribution on the observation
    coefficients. }

  \item{initial.state.prior}{An object of class
    \code{\link[Boom]{MvnPrior}}, describing the prior distribution of
    the initial state vector (at time 1).}

  \item{timestamps}{If \code{response} is in long format (i.e. a vector
    instead of a matrix) this argument is a vector of the same
    length indicating the time index to which each element of
    \code{response} belongs. }

  \item{series.id}{If \code{response} is in long format (i.e. a vector
    instead of a matrix) this argument is a vector of the same length
    indicating the time series to which each element of \code{response}
    belongs. }

  \item{sdy}{A vector giving the standard deviation of each series to be
    modeled.  This argument is only necessary if \code{response} cannot
    be supplied directly.}

  \item{\dots}{Extra arguments passed to
    \code{\link[BoomSpikeSlab]{ConditionalZellnerPrior}}, used to create
    a default prior for the observation coefficients when
    \code{coefficient.prior} is left as \code{NULL}.}
}

\value{ Returns a list with the elements necessary to specify a local
  linear trend state model.}
