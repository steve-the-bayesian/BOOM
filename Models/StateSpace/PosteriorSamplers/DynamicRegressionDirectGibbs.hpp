  // A "direct Gibbs" sampler for sparse dynamic regression models in the
  // spirit of Nakajima and West.  This sampler could be improved (as shown in
  // Scott(2002)) using FB sampling for the inclusion indicators after
  // integrating out the coefficients.
  //
  // The dynamic regression model is y[t] = X[t] * beta[t] + epsilon[t], with
  // X[t] fully observed, epsilon[t] ~ MVN(0, sigma^2 I), independent across t,
  // where the dimension of I is n[t] X n[t], and with state dynamics on beta as
  // follows.
  //
  // Denote the scalar elements of beta[t] as beta[j, t], and let gamma[j, t] =
  // 1 if beta[j, t] is nonzero and gamma[j, t] = 0 if beta[j, t] == 0.  The
  // model assumes gamma[j, t] evolves independently across j with gamma[j, t] ~
  // Bernoulli(pi_j[gamma[j, t-1]]).  That is, gamma[j, t] evolves according to
  // a 2-state discrete time Markov chain.
  //
  // The prior parameters of the Markov chain are supplied by the user in the
  // form of three quantities:
  //
  //   - An expected duration (number of time periods) of a visit to state 1.
  //   - The stationary probability of being in state 1.
  //   - A sample size.
  //
  // When these three numbers are passed through a function infer_Markov_prior
  // they are converted into a 2x2 matrix of positive counts for a product
  // Dirichlet prior.

    //     deviation.
    //   residual_sd_prior_sample_size: A prior sample size.  The number of

    //     an active coefficient's value might change in a typical time period.
    //     This is a Vector with one entry per coefficient.
